# Frontend Health Check Fix

## Problem Analysis ‚úÖ

From the deploy logs, we can see:
- ‚úÖ NGINX is starting successfully
- ‚úÖ Configuration is valid
- ‚úÖ Backend URL is correctly configured
- ‚ùå Health check at `/nginx-health` is failing

## Root Cause

Railway's health check is failing because:
1. **Port mismatch**: NGINX might be listening on port 80, but Railway expects it on a different port
2. **Timing issue**: Health check might be running before NGINX is fully ready
3. **Network configuration**: Railway's internal networking might need specific configuration

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Dynamic Port Configuration

Updated `nginx.conf` to use Railway's PORT environment variable:
```nginx
server {
    listen ${PORT:-80};
    server_name _;
    # ... rest of config
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Entrypoint Script

Updated `docker-entrypoint.sh` to handle PORT substitution:
```bash
PORT=${PORT:-80}
sed -i "s|\${PORT:-80}|${PORT}|g" /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
echo "üöÄ Starting NGINX on port $PORT..."
```

### 3. Better Logging

Added detailed logging to see exactly what's happening:
- Port configuration
- NGINX configuration verification
- Startup confirmation

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `nginx.conf` - Added PORT variable support
- ‚úÖ `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Enhanced with PORT handling
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Updated comments for clarity

## Testing the Fix

After redeployment, check the deploy logs for:

1. **Port Configuration**:
   ```
   üîß Configuring NGINX with:
      BACKEND_URL: https://stock-analyze-backend-production.up.railway.app
      PORT: [RAILWAY_PORT]
   ```

2. **NGINX Configuration**:
   ```
   üìã NGINX configuration:
   listen [RAILWAY_PORT];
   proxy_pass https://stock-analyze-backend-production.up.railway.app;
   ```

3. **Successful Startup**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ NGINX configuration is valid
   üöÄ Starting NGINX on port [RAILWAY_PORT]...
   ```

## Health Check Verification

Once deployed, test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://stock-analyze-frontend-production.up.railway.app/nginx-health
```

Expected response:
```
healthy
```

## Alternative Solutions

If the health check still fails, try these alternatives:

### Option 1: Increase Health Check Timeout

In `railway.json`, increase the timeout:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/nginx-health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Add Startup Delay

Add a small delay in the entrypoint script:
```bash
echo "‚è≥ Waiting for NGINX to fully initialize..."
sleep 5
exec nginx -g "daemon off;"
```

### Option 3: Alternative Health Check

Create a simple HTML health check:
```nginx
location /health {
    return 200 "OK";
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
}
```

## Current Status

Based on the logs:
- ‚úÖ Backend is deployed and working
- ‚úÖ Frontend NGINX is starting correctly
- ‚úÖ Configuration is valid
- ‚è≥ Health check needs the PORT fix

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy frontend** with the PORT configuration fix
2. **Monitor deploy logs** for the new port information
3. **Test health endpoint** once deployment completes
4. **Verify full application** functionality

The health check should pass after the PORT configuration is properly handled!
