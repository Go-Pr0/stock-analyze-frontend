# Frontend 502 Bad Gateway Error Fix

## Problem Analysis ‚úÖ

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Health check `/nginx-health` works (returns 200)
- ‚úÖ NGINX is running on port 8080
- ‚úÖ Configuration is valid
- ‚ùå Main site returns 502 Bad Gateway

## Root Cause Analysis

A 502 error when health check works indicates:

1. **NGINX is running** (health check proves this)
2. **Port binding is correct** (health check accessible)
3. **Static file serving issue** (main site fails)

Possible causes:
- React build files missing or corrupted
- NGINX can't find/serve index.html
- File permissions issue
- Build process failing silently

## Debugging Steps Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Enhanced Logging
Added to `docker-entrypoint.sh`:
- Static file directory listing
- Index.html existence check
- File content preview
- Detailed NGINX configuration output

### 2. NGINX Error Logging
Added to `nginx.conf`:
```nginx
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log debug;
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
```

### 3. Build Verification
Added to `Dockerfile`:
- Build output verification
- Index.html existence check
- Directory listing after build

## Expected Debug Output

After redeployment, look for these in deploy logs:

### Build Stage
```
Build completed, checking for index.html:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root [SIZE] [DATE] dist/index.html
```

### Runtime Stage
```
üìÅ Checking static files:
total [SIZE]
-rw-r--r-- 1 nginx nginx [SIZE] [DATE] index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 nginx nginx [SIZE] [DATE] [other files]

‚úÖ index.html exists
üìù First few lines of index.html:
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Failing
**Symptoms:** No index.html in static files listing
**Solution:** Check build logs for errors, fix dependencies

### Issue 2: File Permissions
**Symptoms:** Files exist but 502 error persists
**Solution:** Verify nginx user can read files

### Issue 3: Wrong Build Output
**Symptoms:** Files exist but wrong content
**Solution:** Check Vite configuration, ensure proper build

### Issue 4: NGINX Configuration
**Symptoms:** Files exist, permissions OK, still 502
**Solution:** Check NGINX error logs for specific errors

## Testing Commands

After redeployment, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check (should work)
curl https://stock-analyze-frontend-production.up.railway.app/nginx-health

# Main site (currently failing)
curl -v https://stock-analyze-frontend-production.up.railway.app/

# Check response headers
curl -I https://stock-analyze-frontend-production.up.railway.app/
```

## Quick Fix Attempts

### Option 1: Simplified NGINX Config
If complex config is the issue, try minimal config:
```nginx
server {
    listen ${PORT:-80};
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
    
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    
    location /nginx-health {
        return 200 "healthy\n";
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Alternative Static Serving
Test with simple file serving:
```nginx
location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
}
```

### Option 3: Manual File Check
Add to entrypoint script:
```bash
# Test file serving manually
echo "Testing file access:"
cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html | head -1
```

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy with enhanced debugging**
2. **Check build logs** for verification output
3. **Check deploy logs** for static file listing
4. **Identify specific failure point** from debug output
5. **Apply targeted fix** based on findings

## Expected Resolution

The enhanced debugging will reveal:
- Whether build is producing files
- Whether files are copied correctly
- Whether NGINX can access files
- Specific error causing 502

This will allow for a targeted fix to resolve the 502 error.
